1) Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

  #
  ##
  ###
  ####
  #####
  ######
  #######
2) Use nested loops to create the following:

# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #

3)Print the following pattern:

0 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 6 = 36
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 8 = 64
9 x 9 = 81
10 x 10 = 100

4) Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.

5) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers

6) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers

7) Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

8) Go to the data folder and use the Allcountries.py file. 
	Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word land.

9)Go to the data folder and use the countries.py file.
	a) What are the total number of languages in the data
	b) Find the ten most spoken languages from the data
	c) Find the 10 most populated countries in the world
